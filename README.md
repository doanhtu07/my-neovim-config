# My Neovim Config

Hey guys, this is the Neovim config that I learned from Josean Martinez on Youtube "How I Setup Neovim To Make It AMAZING in 2024: The Ultimate Guide"

But of course, I changed a bit to fit my taste and add more notes so that I can recall some information.

This is the first time I use Neovim, and it is honestly overwhelming. But at the same time, it's a great journey.

You guys can fork or clone this to use for your Neovim. Remember to watch the Youtube video by Josean to have a better understanding of each plugin is doing.

## Prerequisites

Besides Neovim itself and many plugins, some plugins require extra packages available from your shell.

I cannot recall everything since there are many dependencies from different plugins.

Here are some of the dependencies that live outside of Neovim ecosystem:

- eza (better ls)
- fzf (Fuzzy find files)
- fd (better find)

To know whether a plugin depends on something from your environment, check that plugin Github page and documentation.
