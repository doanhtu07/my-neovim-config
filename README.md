# My Neovim Config

Hey guys, this is the Neovim config that I learned from Josean Martinez on Youtube "How I Setup Neovim To Make It AMAZING in 2024: The Ultimate Guide"

But of course, I changed a bit to fit my taste and add more notes so that I can recall some information.

This is the first time I use Neovim, and it is honestly overwhelming. But at the same time, it's a great journey.

You guys can fork or clone this to use for your Neovim. Remember to watch the Youtube video by Josean to have a better understanding of each plugin is doing.
